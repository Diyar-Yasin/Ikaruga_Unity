// PlayerDamage
//              This script handles the player taking damage, including invincibility and audio
//          effects.
//
//          UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Audio for the hurt/death events have not yet been added. Also, I
//          may decide to handle Game Over in this script. Although it might be beneficial to have
//          a separate one that simultaneously deals with switching game scenes (if the player were
//          to quit to menu). Death (when lives <= 1) has yet to be added as well.
